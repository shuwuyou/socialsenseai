# Advanced Multi-Agent RAG System: Final Project

This repository is the final integrated project that stitches together the work from:
- **Assignment 1 (Parts 1 & 2):** Data processing, chunking, embedding, and Pinecone vector database retrieval.
- **Assignment 3:** Fine-tuning a T5 model using LoRA for summarization.
- **Assignment 4:** Building an advanced agentic RAG workflow using LangGraph.

The system implements an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow that uses multiple LLM-based agents. At least one of these agents uses a LoRA fine-tuned T5 model. 
**My project runs within 5 min, therefore according to TA Tom, I don't need a Unit Test**.
The system supports four approaches:
1. **Base LLM:** Directly querying ChatOpenAI (no retrieval).
2. **Basic RAG:** Retriever + ChatOpenAI answer generation.
3. **Agentic RAG (Base Summarization):** Uses ChatOpenAI summarization in a multi-agent system.
4. **Agentic RAG (Fine-Tuned Summarization):** Uses the LoRA fine-tuned T5 model for summarization in a multi-agent system.

A web application (using Flask) provides a real chat-like interface where users enter a query and receive four answers generated by these different workflows.

Below is a discussion on the qualitative differences among the four workflows, based on the provided output examples:

### Qualitative Discussion on Response Quality

**1. Base LLM (No RAG):**

- **Detail and Structure:**  
  The Base LLM response is detailed and well-structured. It presents several enumerated points that clearly outline benefits or impacts. For example, in the renewable energy query, it lists multiple advantages with clear headings (e.g., environmental protection, energy independence).

- **Generic and Knowledge-Driven:**  
  However, while detailed, the response reflects the generic knowledge embedded in the LLM. It may not be tailored to the specific nuances of the query context since it does not leverage external documents or specialized context.

**2. Basic RAG (Retriever + LLM):**

- **Conciseness:**  
  The Basic RAG response tends to be more concise. It retrieves documents based on the query, then generates an answer by combining those retrieved pieces. In the example, it provides a brief summary that captures a few key aspects (e.g., sustainability and clean air).

- **Limited Integration:**  
  Since the Basic RAG system only appends retrieved documents to the prompt without additional processing, the answer might miss some depth or integration compared to the base LLM. It may also vary in quality depending on the relevance of retrieved documents.

**3. Agentic RAG (Base Summarization):**

- **Improved Coherence:**  
  With the agentic workflow that uses ChatOpenAI for summarization, the response is more integrated and coherent. The summarization node helps to condense the retrieved documents into a focused summary before generating the final answer. This leads to a response that is generally more aligned with the core aspects of the query.

- **Context-Aware Integration:**  
  The summarization here benefits from the LLM’s ability to merge multiple pieces of information into a unified answer, which typically results in a response that is both concise and contextually rich. For instance, the answer regarding renewable energy combines environmental, economic, and social aspects in a unified narrative.

**4. Agentic RAG (Fine-Tuned Summarization):**

- **Enhanced Specificity and Nuance:**  
  The Advanced Agentic RAG with Fine-Tuned Summarization produces the most refined and detailed responses. By incorporating a LoRA fine-tuned T5 model for summarization, the system leverages specialized training to extract key information from the retrieved documents. This often results in a summary that captures multiple nuanced benefits or challenges.

- **Higher Quality Output:**  
  In the renewable energy example, the fine-tuned model generates an answer that is not only detailed but also well-organized, enumerating several key points (e.g., environmental impact, energy independence, job creation, cost savings, sustainability). The response exhibits a clearer focus and provides a more balanced view compared to the base summarization.

- **Contextual Accuracy:**  
  Additionally, the fine-tuned summarization tends to be more accurate in reflecting the specific context of the query. For instance, it differentiates between environmental, economic, and resource-based benefits more effectively, which can lead to a higher-quality, trustworthy answer.

---

### Overall

- **Transition from Base LLM to Advanced Agentic RAG:**  
  As you move from the Base LLM to the advanced RAG systems, there is a clear trend in quality improvement:
  - **Base LLM:** Offers detailed, structured answers but might be generic.
  - **Basic RAG:** Introduces retrieved context, though the integration is somewhat superficial.
  - **Agentic RAG with Base Summarization:** Provides better integration and coherence by summarizing retrieved data before generating the answer.
  - **Agentic RAG with Fine-Tuned Summarization:** Delivers the most refined responses by leveraging a specialized fine-tuned model to extract nuanced insights, resulting in answers that are comprehensive, accurate, and tailored to the query.
